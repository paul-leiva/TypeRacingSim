# TypeRacingSim
 A type racing game to boost your WPM

This app was originally attempted to be deployed via [Heroku](http://google.com), however it was not working when it tried to fetch quotes for an unknown reason. Thus, it can only be played on your local machine at this time.

## How to play:
1. Download this entire repository to your local machine.
2. Place the repository in a folder if it does not default to one.
3. Go into the folder and **right-click index.html** and "Open With" Google Chrome.
![start](./images/start.jpg?raw=true)
4. The page should open with a timer, quote, and input box displayed (as shown below).
![open](/images/open.jpg?raw=true)
5. Correct characters will be colored *GREEN*. Incorrect characters will be colored *RED*. Characters are *CASE SENSITITVE*.
![correct-incorrect](/images/correct-incorrect.jpg?raw=true)
6. Once all characters are correctly typed, the timer will reset and the next quote will be displayed.
![last char](/images/last char.jpg?raw=true)
(this change happens upon typing the last character)
![new](/images/new.jpg?raw=true)
